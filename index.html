                <p class="article__title heading-text">U.S. students’ academic achievement still lags that of their
                    peers in
                    many other countries</p>
                <div class="article__txt">
                    <p>How do U.S. students compare with their peers around the world? Recently released data from
                        international
                        math and science assessments indicate that U.S. students continue to rank around the middle of
                        the pack,
                        and behind many other advanced industrial nations.
                        One of the biggest cross-national tests is the Programme for International Student Assessment
                        (PISA),
                        which every three years measures reading ability, math and science literacy and other key skills
                        among
                        15-year-olds in dozens of developed and developing countries. The most recent PISA results, from
                        2015,
                        placed the U.S. an unimpressive 38th out of 71 countries in math and 24th in science. Among the
                        35
                        members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which sponsors the PISA
                        initiative, the U.S. ranked 30th in math and 19th in science.
                    </p>
                    <p>Younger American students fare somewhat better on a similar cross-national assessment, the Trends
                        in
                        International Mathematics and Science Study. That study, known as TIMSS, has tested students in
                        grades
                        four and eight every four years since 1995. In the most recent tests, from 2015, 10 countries
                        (out of 48
                        total) had statistically higher average fourth-grade math scores than the U.S., while seven
                        countries
                        had higher average science scores. In the eighth-grade tests, seven out of 37 countries had
                        statistically higher average math scores than the U.S., and seven had higher science scores.</p>
                    <p>Another long-running testing effort is the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a project
                        of the
                        federal Education Department. In the most recent NAEP results, from 2015, average math scores
                        for
                        fourth- and eighth-graders fell for the first time since 1990. A team from Rutgers University is
                        analyzing the NAEP data to try to identify the reasons for the drop in math scores.</p>
                    <p>The average fourth-grade NAEP math score in 2015 was 240 (on a scale of 0 to 500), the same level
                        as in
                        2009 and down from 242 in 2013. The average eighth-grade score was 282 in 2015, compared with
                        285 in
                        2013; that score was the lowest since 2007. (The NAEP has only tested 12th-graders in math four
                        times
                        since 2005; their 2015 average score of 152 on a 0-to-300 scale was one point lower than in 2013
                        and
                        2009.)
                        Looked at another way, the 2015 NAEP rated 40% of fourth-graders, 33% of eighth-graders and 25%
                        of
                        12th-graders as “proficient” or “advanced” in math. While far fewer fourth- and eighth-graders
                        now rate
                        at “below basic,” the lowest performance level (18% and 29%, respectively, versus 50% and 48% in
                        1990),
                        improvement in the top levels appears to have stalled out. (Among 12th-graders, 38% scored at
                        the lowest
                        performance level in math, a point lower than in 2005.)
                    </p>
                    <p>NAEP also tests U.S. students on science, though not as regularly, and the limited results
                        available
                        indicate some improvement. Between 2009 and 2015, the average scores of both fourth- and
                        eight-graders
                        improved from 150 to 154 (on a 0-to-300 scale), although for 12th-graders the average score
                        remained at
                        150. In 2015, 38% of fourth-graders, 34% of eighth-graders and 22% of 12th-graders were rated
                        proficient
                        or better in science; 24% of fourth-graders, 32% of eighth-graders and 40% of 12th-graders were
                        rated
                        “below basic.”</p>
                    <p>These results likely won’t surprise too many people. In a 2015 Pew Research Center report, only
                        29% of
                        Americans rated their country’s K-12 education in science, technology, engineering and
                        mathematics
                        (known as STEM) as above average or the best in the world. Scientists were even more critical: A
                        companion survey of members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science found
                        that just
                        16% called U.S. K-12 STEM education the best or above average; 46%, in contrast, said K-12 STEM
                        in the
                        U.S. was below average.</p>
